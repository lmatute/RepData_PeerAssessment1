# Introduction to report

The file PA1_template.Rmd contains the code to generate a report as per assignment PA1 on activity measurements.
The  report is generated as an html file PA1_template.html. 

All data is contained in this folder. The zipped data file "activity.zip" is automatically unzipped by the code and read in. 

In summary by using the option knit HTML of R Studion on the PA1_template.Rmd you should reproduce the report
